            <h1>Hello,</h1>
            <p>I'm a senior at Eastern Washington University graduating in the Fall of 2016. When I'm not studying and jamming to mashups of pop songs, you'll probably find me at work. I'm an executive assistant at Inland Imaging Business Associates and a server at The Davenport Grand Hotel. On my rare day off I'll be eating delicious food, playing volleyball, hiking with my golden retrievers, or up in the gym working on my fitness. </p>

            <h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
            <p>So many different topics interest me that it took me years to decide what I want to major in. I enjoy the technical aspects of MIS, the way that HRM can positively impact employees lives, the problem solving within computer science, and the design component of web development. In an ideal world, I'd be able to apply my knowledge in each of these areas during my day-to-day activities at work. Since I've studied business, computer science, and management information systems, I'd love to increase the efficiency of technology within the work space as well as bridge the gap between coders/developers and designers/managers. </p>

   <h3>Inspirational &amp; Moving Quote</h3>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.&rdquo; -Rob Siltanen </blockquote>
